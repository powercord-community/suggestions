# Suggestions

The place where you can share ideas for Powercord plugins. If you want to make a plugin, just look for issues tagged with `up for grabs`!

Remember that suggested plugins must follow [Powercord's Plugin Guildelines](https://github.com/powercord-community/guidelines).

## How does this repository work?

### Submitting an idea
It can pretty much be anything you want. To quote aetheryx, "plugins are like boobs; small, big, it doesn't matter, we love them all". We'll then do a quick review of the plugin and mark it as up for grabs; as long as it's not a duplicated request, the idea already exists, or goes against the [Powercord's Plugin Guildelines](https://github.com/powercord-community/guidelines).

### Working on a plugin
If you want to work on a plugin, make sure to let us know by replying to the issue so we can assign you and mark it as ``work in progress``. We don't want to waste peoples time by having different people working on the same feature, and we want to keep the Powercord plugin ecosystem as clean as possible, which includes avoiding duplicates.

### My plugin is done!
Reply with a link to the GitHub repo of the plugin. We'll then mark the request as completed and <!-- allocate a repository in the community org for you, and once it's live there --> close the issue. <!-- We'll also make it show up in the plugin manager, so everyone will be able to install it! Sweet isn't it? --> We recommend putting it in the #plugin-links channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4DwWFRP) for visibility, as the plugin manager/installer isn't done yet.

### I really want *x* plugin but I can't code
If you find a plugin that you would like to see, be sure to add a :+1: (+1) to it! This way plugin developers will be able to see what plugins are desired the most. Please do not bother the devs to make a plugin, they don't have all day everyday to make plugins for us so be patient!

## About backends

Sometimes your plugin might require a backend to work. We're ready to let people host their backends on our server and allocate a `*.powercord.dev` address.

However to keep our server hamsters alive, you must comply with the following requirements in order to be eligible:

 - Code must meet basic quality standards; which includes reasonable security and not being over-engineered.
 - It must not be resource intensive. We don't have infinite CPU and memory.
 - Backends must be open-sourced wherever you like. Can be GitHub, GitLab, whatever. You are free to choose the license you want.
 - We must be able to run it without having to install a billion things. If you use specific technologies or just want to do it this way, you can use Docker.
